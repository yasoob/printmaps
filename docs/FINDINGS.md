# Mission findings

## 2026-08-21 — Mission initialized

- Research and implementation plan exist in the workspace.
- No app or git repository existed at mission start.
- User selected a Figma-like three-pane editor with a bottom Atlas-style tool palette.
- UI constraints: minimal, tight, no gradients, no unnecessary shadows.
- A public Mapbox token is available in local untracked configuration; origin filtering may currently reject this deployment.
- Primary unresolved technical risks remain Mapbox display/storage terms, browser memory limits for large exports, and honest layered-export semantics.

## Evidence log

### 2026-08-21 — Vertical slice 1: editor shell and contextual selection

- Added React 19, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS v4, MapLibre GL JS, Vitest and Playwright foundations.
- Added global design tokens in `src/theme.css`; `tests/unit/design-tokens.test.ts` prevents ad-hoc color literals in component CSS and requires Tailwind integration.
- Implemented a Figma-like 44px top bar, 240px Layers sidebar, full map canvas, 272px contextual properties sidebar, and compact bottom tool palette.
- Project properties are shown with no selection. Selecting `Route 01` from the layer tree switches to Layer properties; clicking the map clears selection.
- Live OpenFreeMap tiles render in Chromium/WebKit. Browsers without WebGL 2 receive an in-canvas fallback while the rest of the editor remains usable.
- Verified commands:
  - `npm run typecheck` — pass
  - `npm run lint` — pass
  - `npm run build` — pass (bundle-size warning remains)
  - `npm test -- --run` — 2 tests pass
  - `npm run test:e2e` — 6 tests pass across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit
- Screenshot evidence: `test-results/editor-desktop-editor-swit-334b3-roject-and-layer-properties-chromium/editor-desktop.png`.
- Screenshot review: core density/hierarchy is strong; next slice should dim map outside the print frame, prevent bottom toolbar/attribution overlap, and populate actual route/POI/shape canvas layers.
- Known warning: the third-party Liberty style emits non-fatal filter warnings in Chromium/WebKit. Replace or sanitize the style before the completion gate requires a fully clean console.

## Next unresolved slice

Extract the project document and layer state into a tested Zustand domain store with undo/redo, visibility/lock/rename/reorder/delete, then render actual sample overlay geometry on the map.
